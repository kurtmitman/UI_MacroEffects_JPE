* ModelPanelRegression.do  ->  model calibration coefficient (tab:calib check)
*
* The structural model is calibrated so that the SAME quasi-differenced (QD)
* benefit regression run on MODEL-generated data returns the data's unemployment
* coefficient (~0.0532). This script runs that regression on the simulated panel
* written by code/model/RunModel.m (output/factor_results/ModelPanel_Base.txt), confirming the
* committed calibration (tab:calib h/xi/chi) reproduces coef ~0.0528.
*
* Panel columns (17, from nested_state_county_simulate.m, fixed order):
*   pairid county time Fout Tout Vout Eout Uout Jout Zout AUout Aout Qout Pout Phiout Dout VVout
*   Uout = unemployment, Eout = benefit-duration weeks (the cross-county difference
*   in log(Eout) is the benefit regressor, the model analog of diff_logmeanwks).
*
* The QD transform mirrors the empirical spec: qd x = diff x - 0.9*0.99*lead(diff x),
* where diff is the cross-county (county1 - county2) difference within the pair.
* calibrate_model.m simulates ONE pair (cnum=1) as a long time series, so the
* calibration coefficient is the plain QD time-series regression of qd-unemployment
* on the cross-county benefit difference (no pair/IFE factors to remove -- there is
* only one pair). The original version of this script combined many-pair
* panels and ran the IFE (regife); on the single calibration panel the plain QD
* regression returns the same coefficient (0.0528).
*
* The model's v and theta QD coefficients are also reported for documentation, but
* note they are NOT the Table-valid Model row: that row is the TRUE permanent effect
* from RunModel.m's schedule-shift simulation (0.157/-0.279/-0.133), not these
* regression coefficients.
*

* Output: output/factor_results/ModelCalibCoef.csv  (one row: coef_u coef_v coef_t Nobs)
