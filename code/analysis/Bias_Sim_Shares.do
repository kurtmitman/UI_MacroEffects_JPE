* §calibration_bias (~L1960): the county employment-share facts underlying the
* calibration-bias simulation. The paper sets the county<->state productivity
* correlation to 0.02 for border counties accounting for <15% of state employment
* (1,108 counties, avg 2%) and to 0.35 for those >=15% (64 counties, avg 35%), then
* simulates the model to show the induced bias is small (estimate 0.0569 vs true
* 0.0532). Here we reproduce the DATA FACTS (counts + average shares); the 0.0569
* simulation itself is a model-section output.
*
* emp_share = the border county's share of its state's employment (already in
* DataControls; it is the variable the EmpShare Table-1 pairing cuts on at 0.15).
* One county per pair (county_index==1); the two groups partition the 1,172 pairs.
